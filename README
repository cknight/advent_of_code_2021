# Advent of Code 2021

Solutions to the Advent of Code 2021, written in Typescript using [Deno](https://deno.land)

Within each folder:
```
// Run the test
deno test someDay_test.ts

deno run --allow-read mod.ts
```

For info:  It wasn't until day 6 that I properly structured the code and added tests.
